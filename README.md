## design


- adding separators and text continually or atomically
    - I should choose **continually** to abide with spec condition "demonstrate OOP knowledge"
    

- nobody asks me to find separator position as soon as it is given to class
    - everything is much simpler and logical if we process everything at `parse` function
    
    
- we need to output some text inside parallelized function to "demostrate work with threads and synchronization objects"


- what build tool to use
    - Boost.Build
    - CMake
    - nothing
